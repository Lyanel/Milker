Main Character
If your going to make an opened game, then try to put in a creat a character to your main character.
Limited for sure. But give them the ability to pick race, gender, and maybe even age. Perhaps hair color


Raising version
Like, to raise them, like they are almost new born, and how you raise them determine the way they behave, or talk to you.
Like, when you first get one, they cant speak. Then as they level up, frm dif things, they grow more intellegent. Growing in mind, not size, complete with clothing to change, hair styles, fur color, and hidden back stories before they came to the world. Almost like they traveled through deminions and lost thier memorys. If your bad to them, they will become angry, mean, and harmful. Sweet to them, they will be more like a pet, teach them like a human, and they will be more human like the  animal.
