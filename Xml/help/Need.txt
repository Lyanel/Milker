Kind :  	Refer to the Kind of the thing you have/need.... needed object always have a kind.... :
	object : 1 (buildings), 2 (workers), 3 (human slaves (SH)), 4 (animal slaves (SA)), 5 (animals), 
		need/check :  x=0 (all), 6 (Semi-Humans (workers+SH)), 7 (slaves (SH+SA)), 8 (Semi-animals (SA+animals)),
			09 (Earthling People (workers+SA)),			10 (natural Cattle (SH+animals)), 
			11 (People (workers+SH+SA)),				12 (cattle (SH+SA+animals)),
			13 (Earthling being (workers+SA+animals)),	14 (natural being (workers+SH+animals)), 
			15 (Livings being (workers+SH+SA+animals)).
	intel : 1 (research), 2 (upgrade), 3 (synergy), 4 (ascension), 5 (event).

Id :	If Id is present, kind will always be a specific one (beetwen 1 & 5), indicating a specific object (Ex : kind:11 & id:11 => Farm), in that case Level & tree are not needed.
	
Level :	have 2 way of working :
	If lvl<0 the Level of the thing must be = to lvl
	if lvl>0 the Level of the thing must be > to lvl.
	 (if lvl=0 no need to check it)

Tree :  Refer to the tree in which you can have the object : 
	 object : 0 (none), 1 (neutral), 2 (science) or 3 (magic).
	 need/check : 9 (all tree), 5 (neutral & science), 6 (neutral & magic) or 7 (science & magic).
	 Generally 0=9=null=no test needed.

For things : X = the quantity needed.
	
Need : Look what the thing need to be bought

		<need>
			<intels>
				<intel kind="x" id="x" />
				(...)
			</intels>
			<things>
				<thing kind="x" id="x" tree="x" lvl="x">X</thing>
				(...)
			</things>
		</need>

check are similar to need, but only need y thing (1 by default), sometimes needed by neutral intels 
				(most of the time to look if you have a sciences thing or his magic counterpart (like Secret Lab vs Wizard Tower)).
				
		<check true="y">
			<thing kind="x" id="x" tree="x" lvl="x">X</thing>
			<thing kind="x" id="x" tree="x" lvl="x">X</thing>
				(...)
		</check>
