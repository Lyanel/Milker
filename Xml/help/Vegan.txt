WWhat ?
Veganism is both the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products, particularly in diet, and an associated abolitionist philosophy that rejects the commodity status of animals.

Did i hate them ?
No, on the contrary, I am wholeheartedly with them, and if my life conditions were slightly different, I would probably be one of them.

So why ?
In a game about milk where you play the bad guy, with heavy treat on animal and human, having them (, feminist movement, Zamasu & Knuckles) as an opponent flowed naturally.
