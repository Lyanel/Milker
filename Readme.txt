Milker is a Hentai clicker game project started by Lyanel Pheles (me).
Why started ? Because although i have (i think) good idea and I am motivated enough to go as far as possible, my programming skills are extremely poor and my drawing skill are nonexistent.
So if people are interested, I would never say no and even if you wished to change engine (Renpy,html5?), You have "carte blanche" and I will help you as best I can (which means not much :( ).

Milker est un projet de jeu clicker hentai débuté par Lyanel Pheles (moi).
Pourquoi débuté ? Parce que bien que j'aie (je crois) de bonne idée et que je sois suffisamment motivé pour allé le plus loin possible, mes compétences de programmation sont extrêmement mauvaises et mes compétences de dessin sont inexistantes.
Donc si des gens sont interressé, je dirait jamais non et même si vous souhaité changé de moteur (Renpy,html5?), vous avez carte blanche et je vous aiderait du mieux que je peux (se qui signifie pas des masses:( ).
